# FaBiAN
FaBiAN is an open-source FetAl BraIn magnetic resonance Acquisition Numerical phantom that simulates highly realistic T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the developing fetal brain throughout gestation. FaBiAN simulates as closely as possible the physical principles involved in Fast Spin Echo (FSE) sequences at various clinical magnetic field strengths (1.5T and 3T). It reproduces the implementation specificities from several MR vendors (currently, Siemens Healthcare and GE Healthcare). FaBiAN is built on segmented high-resolution anatomical images of the fetal brain across maturation and relies on the extended phase graph (EPG) formalism of the MR signal formation. It is based on a general and realistic setup that includes intensity non-uniformity fields and stochastic movements of the fetus. It is highly flexible in the choice of the sequence parameters and anatomical settings available to the user. With this first MR acquisition simulation framework of the developing fetal brain, we aim at providing the community with a unified environment for the evaluation and validation of various post-processing techniques dedicated to improving the analysis of fetal brain MR images and supporting accurate diagnosis.
